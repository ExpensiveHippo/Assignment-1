                        FN-9315 is a fatal disease. The cause of the disease is currently unknown, but it has been noted that 
                        the expedition team who returned from an expedition from Europa were the first deaths of the disease. 
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The members reported that one of the member, identified as PATIENT 0 (P0), acted psychopatically and 
                        attempted to bite another member when the team was in their sleep. P0 was also reported to have rashes despite 
                        following safety protocols which prevented P0 to come into contact with anything from Europa. The cause of the 
                        rashes are unknown but it is speculated to be an early sign of FN-9315. The team was unable to control P0, and unanimously 
                        to put him down before returning back to Earth. However, P0 was found dead in less than a span of a day.
                        After returning to Earth, the other members later showed signs that replicated the descriptionof P0, and died shortly after.

                    <p>
                        Efforts have been put into researching the origin of FN-9315, what exactly it is, and how it affects us, but most of it has 
                        been futile. Any living thing that is suspected to have contracted FN-9315 dies quickly if it does not cannibalise. Even after 
                        cannibalising, its hunger will not be satiated and will continue attacking other of its kind. There are currently no known
                        methods to restrain or put down those in the late stages of FN-9315 besides starving them.

                        Research. Advise. Prolong. (R.A.P.) is an organization entrusted by governments around the globe that aids mankind battle against cataclysmic 
                        disease outbreaks. Technological advances has allowed us to make great strides in exploration, and we have soon found that we are not the only ones here.
                        This universe is far more complex than we thought, and in the recent centuries, our ravenous desire to extend our control to other worlds
                        has resulted in the appearance of inexplicable disease outbreaks. These diseases are unlike those we have had encountered on Earth in the past,
                        and some of them pose a threat to humanity. R.A.P. categorises these diseases based on their threat level.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        To ensure these diseases do not wipe out humanity, R.A.P. is tasked with conducting RESEARCH on these foreign diseases to find out what these diseases
                        are, how they affect organisms on Earth, how they propogate and how to fight them. R.A.P. will ADVISE what safety procedures to take against these diseases
                        with the information gathered to put an end to these outbreaks. PROLONGING humanity's existence is the final outcome R.A.P. hopes to attain, and we will
                        not settle for anything short of that.
