I WILL REFORMAT THE README AT A LATER DATE

#Topic: A webpage on an organization that study fictional entity or animal.


#Portion:
A. 1 Single-Scroll Page with 3 section --> "Entity of the Day"
B. 1 About Page
C. 1 Become a member Page *
D. 1 Navigation Bar

* Only if required because I'm not confident if I can implement the animations for the Home Page smoothly within a couple of weeks.

#Breakdown:
##A.1. Home Page
Details: Minimalistic with just a basic introduction on the chosen entity 

##A.2. Hero image in the center with interactive buttons
Details: On click, the content of the page will animate out of viewport to give space to lines of text that will animate in from the same direction on the other side of the viewport.

##A.3. Blocks that will show the statistic on that entity 
Details: Population, status -> endangered etc., deaths caused by it, maybe include icons

##B.1. About
Details: SVG from Figma as logo, Mission Statement 

##C.1. Join Us
Details: Handle User input

##D.1 Navigation Bar
Details: Home, About, Discover*, Join. 

* Discover is essentially supposed to be a huge database of entities that the user can browse. When a tab is clicked on, it brings the user to a page similar to the single scroll page, with information regardig that entity instead. It will however be just another home button in my code.
